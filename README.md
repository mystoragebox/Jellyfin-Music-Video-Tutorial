# Jellyfin-Music-Video-Tutorial
Before you begin this is a slow process. This does not use any Jellyfin plugins. I will show you the way for manual input and organisation of the files and setup of Jellyfin for your Music Video library. You will need some software on your computer to make this work. These include:
- Musicbee (or any other music sorting program that can edit MP4 meta)
- ffmpeg
- Powertoys (optional, it makes changing many filenames really easy)
